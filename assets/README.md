# Assets for IPFS

Upload to IPFS via <https://app.pinata.cloud/>

-   `ipfs/json` folder contains the JSON metadata for the contract that's uploaded to IPFS. That address is updated in the contract's BaseURI. Upload whole folder at once. Name as `ukraine-donation-nft-json` and append `v2` etc for newer versions.

-   `ipfs/json-contract` contains a file that `ContractURI()` points to representing metadata for the overall collection. Upload just the file. Name as `ukraine-donation-contract` and append `v2` etc for newer versions.

-   The NFT MP4's themselves are available at https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYN2e159Au44zgNqSs1RVxmnhKWCcsY4xXf6A7NmT16t4 This is under `github/briangershon`'s Pinata account.
