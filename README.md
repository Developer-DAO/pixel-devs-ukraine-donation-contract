# ukraine-donation-nft

![Solidity tests](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/ukraine-donation-nft/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yaml/badge.svg)

## Project Overview

This is the open-source web UI and smart contract code for the [Developer DAO for Ukraine](https://ukraine.developerdao.com/) site.

The proceeds from purchasing our Ukraine NFT go directly toward supporting humanitarian efforts in Ukraine via https://unchain.fund.

Different donation levels offer NFTs in the form of steel, bronze, silver, diamond and platinum. These NFTs may offer additional utility on future Developer DAO projects.

We mint on #polygon though if you want to give directly on another blockchain and forego our NFT, you can donate to Ukraine organizations directly via unchain.fund.

The Developer DAO is a community of people contributing to the future of Web3.

Art design is based on the Developer DAO Pixel Devs <https://pixel-devs.developerdao.com/>.
